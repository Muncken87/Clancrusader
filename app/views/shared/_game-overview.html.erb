    <p>The world of Clan Crusaders takes place on Erf, a radish-infested dimension created by the legendary Sorcerer Jimmy. Three dramatically different cultures, the Dragons, the Thieves, and the Knights, are pit against each other in a contest with the gravest consequences. The winner will be returned to their home in the Kingdom of Nob; the losers will be trapped in Erf with nothing but the radishes.</p>

    <p>This is YOUR chance to take up arms and decide the doom or destiny of the world of Erf. Fight alongside Faction Leaders as a Kommandant to Escape from Erf!  Use military tactics, surprise strategy, and old-fashioned luck to defeat Player or Computer opponents using the hexagonal, real-time, strategy system.</p>
